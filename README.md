## Short Description

- This project is an online store designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for tech enthusiasts. The website features a clean and modern layout, showcasing a variety of tech accessories, including headphones, cameras, and laptops. Users can easily navigate through product categories and benefit from clear images and detailed descriptions. The site also includes filtering functionality, allowing customers to sort products by category or brand, and is optimized for responsiveness across different devices, ensuring a user-friendly interface.

## List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project:

1. Components: The building blocks of a React application, which can be functional or class-based, used to create reusable UI elements.

2. JSX (JavaScript XML): A syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize UI components.

3. Props (Properties): A way to pass data from parent components to child components, enabling component customization and reusability.

4. State: A built-in object that allows components to manage and respond to changes in data, triggering re-renders when the state is updated.

5. Hooks: Functions like useState, useEffect, and custom hooks that allow functional components to manage state and side effects.

6. Event Handling: Reactâ€™s approach to handling user interactions, such as clicks or form submissions, using synthetic events.

7. Conditional Rendering: Techniques to display different UI elements based on certain conditions, such as using ternary operators or logical && operators.

8. Context API: A way to manage global state and pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

9. Routing: Using libraries like React Router to manage navigation and rendering of different components based on URL paths.

## I used context-API for handling and managing data
